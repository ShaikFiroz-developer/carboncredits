Decentralized application (dApp) designed for managing and trading carbon credits using blockchain technology. Built on the Ethereum network, it leverages smart contracts to create an ERC20-based token called CCT (Carbon Credit Token), which represents carbon credits. The system includes three main participants:

1.Suppliers: These are entities, such as companies or organizations, that carry out carbon-reduction projects. They submit project reports, which are stored on IPFS for transparency. Each report includes details like the project name, company information, geographic location, and carbon credits requested.

2.Auditors: Auditors are responsible for validating supplier-submitted projects. They verify the authenticity and impact of these projects through an Auditor Dashboard, where they can approve or reject carbon credit requests. Only approved projects are issued carbon credits, which helps maintain the integrity of the system.

3.Regulatory Authority: The Regulatory Authority acts as an overseer, ensuring that the platform aligns with industry standards, regulations, and best practices. They have final authority over any disputes and monitor the actions of both suppliers and auditors to ensure compliance. The Regulatory Authority may also impose penalties or revoke credits if non-compliance or fraud is detected.

4.Buyers: Buyers, which could be companies or individuals looking to offset their carbon footprint, purchase verified carbon credits on the marketplace. They can acquire credits directly from the marketplace, from other buyers, or from suppliers. Each participant—buyer, supplier, auditor, and regulatory authority—is assigned a unique NFT identifier, which tracks all associated transactions and carbon credit data.

5.CCT (Carbon Credit Token): This ERC20-based token represents the verified carbon credits within the platform. Each credit is backed by real, verified emission reductions.

The platform ensures transparency, accountability, and efficiency in carbon credit trading, with all transactions and certifications recorded on the blockchain. The project’s backend is powered by Node.js and interacts with smart contracts through ethers.js, while Cloudinary is integrated to manage any additional file uploads.
